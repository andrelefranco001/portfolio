    title: "Kino E - Streaming Platform",
    description: `Kino E is a streaming platform that celebrates the diversity of cinema, blending independent gems, cult classics, and handpicked commercial films that have left a cultural mark. Our mission is to curate films that matter — stories that move beyond trends and algorithms to offer a richer, more meaningful viewing experience.

Every week, Kino E brings a new themed collection, connecting films through creative ideas, visual styles, or cultural relevance. Whether it’s bold experimental works, iconic blockbusters, or emerging voices from around the world, we believe great cinema comes in many forms — and all of them deserve a place here.

At Kino E, we invite you to watch differently. To slow down, to explore, and to discover films that might just become your next obsession. Because we believe that cinema is more than just entertainment — it’s a journey, a conversation, and a reflection of the world we live in.`,

    title: "The Poem Mind: A Journey Through Words",
    description: `The Poem Mind was created to give poetry a space where it can unfold naturally, without interruption or predefined order. Instead of searching for poems, you let them find you. Each time you enter, a vertical scroll of words awaits, blending poets from different eras, styles, and languages.

This is not an archive, nor a traditional literary site. It’s a flowing stream — a space where literature becomes fluid, where poems from the past and present coexist and expand endlessly. Every visit is different, every scroll a new discovery.`,
